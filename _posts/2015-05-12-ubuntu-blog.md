Today I installed ubuntu 14.04 64bit on my desktop PC. It works fine now. I'm typing on it now. I love this feeling.

I will try to use linux replace most of my works used to do on my windows in the future.

This post is just a test post.It means I start use jekyll to post blog now.

I will do more post in another day, but today I will just end it here.

Keep fighting!
